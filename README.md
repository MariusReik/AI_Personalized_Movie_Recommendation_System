# **Personalized Movie Recommendation System**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a **personalized movie recommendation web app** that uses machine learning to suggest films based on user preferences and mood. Our goal is to develop a user-friendly, machine-learning-based web application that enables users to input their mood, genres, and other preferences, receiving a curated list of movie recommendations in return.

---

## **Project Goals**

### **Objective**
- Create a functional, interactive web app that provides personalized movie recommendations.

### **Core Tasks**
1. **Model Development**: Implement a recommendation model using machine learning techniques.
2. **User Interface**: Design a simple and interactive frontend.
3. **Deployment**: Host the app online or provide a recorded demo if deployment is not feasible.

### **Expected Outcome**
- A live or locally-hosted web app, powered by ML models, that delivers personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**
- **Python** for data handling and ML model development.
- **Flask** or **FastAPI** to serve the recommendation model through API endpoints.

### **Frontend**
- **Streamlit** or **Gradio** for building an interactive and responsive UI.

### **Machine Learning Models**
1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes movie metadata such as genres, directors, and actors.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages user preferences and historical data to make recommendations.

### **Data Sources**
- **MovieLens Dataset** (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)) for collaborative filtering and user-movie interactions.
- **IMDb or TMDb APIs** for retrieving movie metadata like synopsis, cast, and genre details.

### **Deployment**
- **Streamlit Cloud** or **Gradio Hub** for quick deployment.
- Alternative cloud services include **Heroku** or **AWS** for more custom configurations.

├── notebooks/                # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and model development
├── src/                      # Source code
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py # Data cleaning and feature engineering
│   ├── recommendation.py     # ML models and recommendation algorithms
│   ├── app.py                # Main application and API endpoints
├── requirements.txt          # List of dependencies
├── README.md                 # Project overview and instructions
├── report/                   # Final project report
└── templates/                # HTML templates (if using Flask)
```

## **Dataset and Preprocessing**

### **1. Dataset Selection**
- Use the **MovieLens** dataset for collaborative filtering and user rating data.
- Supplement with **TMDb or IMDb API** to add detailed movie metadata.

### **2. Data Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features (e.g., genres, keywords, director).
   - Standardize genres, cast, and director fields.
   - Create a **user-movie interaction matrix** for collaborative filtering.

### **Implementation**:
- All data processing functions are in `src/data_preprocessing.py`.

---

## **Model Development**

### **1. Content-Based Filtering**
- **Approach**: Vectorize movie metadata (e.g., genres, director) using **TF-IDF** or similar techniques.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Use **cosine similarity** to find movies similar to those a user has liked.

### **2. Collaborative Filtering**
- **Approach**: Use a **user-item interaction matrix** and apply **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.
- **Goal**: Predict movies that similar users enjoyed.

### **3. Hybrid Recommendation System**
- Combine content-based and collaborative filtering to improve accuracy and personalization.

**Implementation**:
- Functions for each recommendation method are implemented in `src/recommendation.py`.

## **API Integration for Movie Metadata**

The app uses external movie databases to fetch relevant movie details. Here’s how it integrates:

### **1. The Movie Database (TMDb) API**
   - **Overview**: A popular and free-to-use API for movie data, requiring an API key.
   - **Data**: Provides movie descriptions, genres, cast, ratings, and similar movie recommendations.
   - **API Endpoints**:
      - Movie details: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
      - Recommendations: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}/recommendations?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
   - **Setup**: 
      - Sign up at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and generate an API key.
      - Store the API key in a secure location (e.g., `.env` file).

### **2. OMDb API (Open Movie Database)**
   - **Overview**: Another popular API, offering IMDb ratings and basic movie metadata.
   - **API Endpoint Examples**:
      - Movie search by title: `http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=movie_title&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`
      - IMDb ID lookup: `http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`

### **API Integration Code Example**
The following code can be added to `src/recommendation.py` to fetch movie metadata:

```python
import requests
import os

def fetch_movie_details(movie_id):
    api_key = os.getenv("TMDB_API_KEY")
    url = f"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Could not retrieve movie details"}
```

## **Web Application Development**

### **User Flow**
1. User selects mood and genre preferences.
2. The backend processes the input and calls the recommendation model.
3. The app displays personalized movie recommendations.

### **Backend Implementation**
- **Flask or FastAPI** will serve the recommendation model as an API.
- In `app.py`, define endpoints that receive user input and return recommendations.

### **Frontend Implementation**
- **Streamlit** or **Gradio** will display an intuitive UI.
- Key features:
   - **Mood Selection**: Users choose their mood from predefined options.
   - **Genre Selection**: Users select a preferred genre.

**Example Code** for UI in Streamlit:

```python
import streamlit as st
from src.recommendation import get_recommendations

st.title("Personalized Movie Recommendation System")
mood = st.selectbox("Select your mood", ["Happy", "Sad", "Adventurous", "Romantic"])
genre = st.selectbox("Choose a genre", ["Comedy", "Drama", "Action", "Thriller"])

if st.button("Get Recommendations"):
    recommendations = get_recommendations(mood, genre)
    for movie in recommendations:
        st.write(movie)
```
